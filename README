QuizApp android  , its a  clone of popular trivia app QuizUp , written totally in android, without use of any graphic libraries.
QuizApp server runs on tornado, can scale over multiple instances by deploying more webservers.

QuizApp uses websockets for the multiplayer game.


Its a eclipse android Project . You will need QuizApp_tornado_server to launch the app you can clone it from here.

Steps to get the clinet and server working.

Setting up Server :
1) Launch mongo DB
2) Configure Config.py , change the dbServer address to point to mongoDb.
3) Change the WebServerMap and ExternalWebServerMap to appropriate address of how your server ip address looks from the internal and external viewpoint.
4) Give a Unique server Id in Config.py

---Loading Data---
5) Configure load_spreadsheet.py with the your spreadsheet containing your data. see this sample/clone it.


You can additonally load sample questions from telugu movies by
6) Load sample questions by running load_question_data.py and input as suggested in the output.
7) Once the data is loaded , start the server by running server.py

Client Configuration
8) In ServerCalls.java change the SERVER_ADDR and CDN path variables to suit your need ,pointing to the webserver and the server which hosts your images and asset files.


Conversations/chatting works with Google GCM notifications for now. will change to websockets at later point of time.

----Scaling the webserver----
To launch a new webserver, change Config.py and add your current server to existing 'WebserveMap' and 'ExternalWebServerMap' with your server id ,  to the existing list , this list will be propagated to other servers , so update it carefully before launching the new server. hola ! , you are good to go, it integrates seemlessly in terms of horizontal scaling, MongoDb can be deployed in a cluster to scale the db.

This is a hobby project, needs many changes perticularly in ui. All contributions and modifications are copylefted.

Thanks Vinay for contributions to code.
